****Old Bejeweled
Original version of the game I created while 
I was still learning Java. The code is nothing short of 
spaghetti code, but I will keep it in the repo as a 
reminder of how much of a newbie I was, and as an example 
of how not to write code.

1)Compile
javac OldBejeweled.java

2)Run 
java OldBejeweled.java


**Improved Bejeweled Game 
"Re-implementation" of original game using a better
desing and with more features.

1)Compile
javac Bejeweled.java

2)Run 
java Bejeweled.java
